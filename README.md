# Bloc Jams
A Bloc project in which we were asked to build a music player app using jQuery.   

 **As part of the project, we used jQuery to:**  
	•	display information such as album name, artist, and song names  
  •	give functionality to time and volume sliders   
	•	give functionality to play, pause, next song, and previous song buttons.  
	•	display current and total time for song currently playing.  
  • convert time to a M:SS format.
